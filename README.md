## How to use the app

This app supports three usage scenarios: Live Camera, Static Image, and CameraX enabled live camera.

### Static Image scenario
The static image scenario is identical to the live camera scenario, but instead relies on images fed into the app through the gallery.

### CameraX Live Preview scenario
The CameraX live preview scenario is very similar to the native live camera scenario, but instead relies on CameraX live preview. Note: CameraX is only supported on API level 21+.
